## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A World of Warcraft Mythic+ healer wants to access the same encounter-specific healing information available in the iPad app through a web browser. They need to browse dungeons, view boss encounters, and see color-coded ability cards with healer-specific guidance, all without requiring an iPad device.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a healer opens the web app in their browser, **When** they view the dungeon list, **Then** they see the same 8 War Within Season dungeons with identical information as the iPad app
2. **Given** a healer selects a dungeon in the web app, **When** they view boss encounters, **Then** they see the same boss details and color-coded ability cards as the iPad version
3. **Given** a healer views ability cards in the web app, **When** they see critical abilities like "Alerting Shrill", **Then** the visual emphasis and healer action guidance matches the iPad app experience
4. **Given** a healer is using the web app during a raid, **When** their internet connection is lost, **Then** they can continue accessing previously loaded encounter data [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: offline support requirements for web version?]

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to access the web app on a mobile phone versus desktop?
- How does the system handle users who have both iPad and web versions - should bookmarks/preferences sync?
- What happens when the web app is accessed on very small or very large screen sizes?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*
