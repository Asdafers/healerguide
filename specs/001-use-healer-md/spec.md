## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
As a World of Warcraft healer preparing for or actively participating in Mythic+ dungeons, I need quick access to encounter-specific healing information so that I can proactively manage healing cooldowns, anticipate damage patterns, and understand my role-specific responsibilities without sifting through general dungeon guides meant for all roles.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am about to enter "Ara-Kara, City of Echoes" dungeon, **When** I open the app and select this dungeon, **Then** I see a list of all bosses in chronological encounter order
2. **Given** I select the "Avanoxx" boss encounter, **When** the boss details load, **Then** I see a healer summary and color-coded ability cards showing damage profiles, my required actions, and critical insights
3. **Given** I am in combat and need quick reference, **When** I view an ability card for "Alerting Shrill", **Then** I immediately see it's a Critical damage profile requiring a pre-planned group healing cooldown
4. **Given** I have no internet connection during gameplay, **When** I open the app, **Then** all dungeon and encounter data is available offline
5. **Given** I want to return to the dungeon list, **When** I use the navigation, **Then** I can easily move between boss, dungeon, and home screens

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a new dungeon season is released and content needs updating?
- How does the system handle searching for specific encounters across multiple dungeons?
- What occurs if a user tries to access content for an outdated season?

## Requirements

- **FR-005**: System MUST provide a concise healer summary for each boss encounter
- **FR-006**: System MUST function completely offline once initial data is loaded
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide persistent navigation allowing easy movement between home, dungeon, and boss screens
- **FR-008**: System MUST include search functionality to find specific dungeons or bosses by name
- **FR-009**: System MUST filter out non-healer relevant information (tank positioning details, DPS rotations)
