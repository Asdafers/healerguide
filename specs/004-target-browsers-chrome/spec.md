**Feature Branch**: `004-target-browsers-chrome`
**Created**: 2025-09-15
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "target browsers: chrome; deployment: self hosted; offline capabilities: none; data synchronisation: use a common data store; performance requirements: no new requirements"

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ’ Feature request: Chrome web app with self-hosted deployment and shared data store
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ’ Actors: Mythic+ healers using Chrome browser
   ’ Actions: Access dungeon/boss/ability data via web interface
   ’ Data: Shared data store between iPad app and web app
   ’ Constraints: Chrome-only, self-hosted, online-only operation
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ’ All major aspects clarified in user description
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ’ Primary scenario: Healer accesses encounter data via Chrome browser
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ’ Chrome web interface with shared data store access
6. Identify Key Entities
   ’ Same entities as iPad app: Season, Dungeon, BossEncounter, Ability
7. Run Review Checklist
   ’ All requirements clear and testable
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

## ¡ Quick Guidelines
-  Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- L Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- =e Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A World of Warcraft Mythic+ healer wants to access the same encounter-specific healing information available in the iPad app through Chrome browser on their desktop or laptop. They need to browse dungeons, view boss encounters, and see color-coded ability cards with healer-specific guidance, using the same data as the iPad app through a shared data store.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a healer opens the web app in Chrome browser, **When** they view the dungeon list, **Then** they see the same 8 War Within Season dungeons with identical information as the iPad app
2. **Given** a healer selects a dungeon in the web app, **When** they view boss encounters, **Then** they see the same boss details and color-coded ability cards as the iPad version
3. **Given** a healer views ability cards in the web app, **When** they see critical abilities like "Alerting Shrill", **Then** the visual emphasis and healer action guidance matches the iPad app experience
4. **Given** content is updated in the shared data store, **When** a healer refreshes the web app, **Then** they see the latest encounter data matching what's available on iPad
5. **Given** a healer is using the web app during a raid, **When** their internet connection is lost, **Then** the web app displays an appropriate error message indicating online connectivity is required

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user tries to access the web app with a browser other than Chrome?
- How does the system handle multiple users accessing the web app simultaneously?
- What happens when the shared data store is temporarily unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide web-based access to all dungeon encounter data available in the iPad app through Chrome browser
- **FR-002**: System MUST display the same 8 War Within Season dungeons with identical boss encounter information from the shared data store

- **FR-004**: System MUST provide healer-specific action guidance and encounter summaries identical to iPad app content
- **FR-005**: System MUST support mouse and keyboard interactions for navigation between dungeons and boss encounters
- **FR-006**: System MUST function exclusively in Chrome browser with appropriate messaging for unsupported browsers
- **FR-007**: System MUST be deployed as a self-hosted web application accessible within the organization's network
