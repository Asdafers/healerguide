```

## T041: Sample Data Generation (Complete)

### File Location
- **Primary**: `/code/healerkit/HealerKit/SampleData/SeasonDataGenerator.swift`

### Generated Content Overview

#### War Within Season 1 (8 Dungeons)
1. **Ara-Kara, City of Echoes** - 3 bosses, integration test compatible
2. **City of Threads** - 4 bosses, complex web architecture
3. **The Dawnbreaker** - 3 bosses, airship environment
4. **The Stonevault** - 4 bosses, earthen artifacts and guardians
5. **Cinderbrew Meadery** - 4 bosses, elemental brewery chaos
6. **Darkflame Cleft** - 3 bosses, volcanic kobold operations
7. **Priory of the Sacred Flame** - 3 bosses, corrupted temple
8. **The Rookery** - 3 bosses, storm dragon nests

### Ability Classification Distribution
- **Critical Abilities**: 25% - Emergency response required, major cooldowns
- **High Damage**: 35% - Priority healing, anticipation needed
- **Moderate Damage**: 25% - Standard healing response
- **Mechanic Abilities**: 15% - Positioning, dispels, team coordination

### Healer-Focused Content Features

#### Damage Profile System
```swift
public struct DamageProfile {
    let type: DamageType          // burst, dot, aoe, mechanic
    let severity: Severity        // critical, high, moderate, low
    let timing: Timing            // immediate, telegraphed, sustained, escalating
    let affectedPlayers: Target   // tank, random, melee, ranged, all, line
    let estimatedDamage: Int?     // Damage estimate for healing planning
    let healingRequired: HealingResponse // emergency, priority, standard, supportive
}
```

#### Healer Guidance Examples
- **Critical**: "Tank buster - prepare for heavy damage. Use cooldowns for high stacks."
- **High**: "High AoE damage to melee range. Pre-heal melee players and be ready with AoE heals."
- **Moderate**: "Single-target damage with movement impairment. Heal and monitor positioning."
- **Mechanic**: "Support trapped players with heals while others break them free."
